# Toy Renderer

This is a personal toy renderer meant as a playground for experimenting with ideas and rendering techniques.

## Building

Please Don't. But if you wish to: 

- Run `generateprojects.bat` to generate VS project files
- Open `ShaderMake.sln` and Compile/Run
- Open `ToyRenderer.sln` and Compile/Run

Top menu -> Engine -> Open Map
- Self explanatory
- Only gltf & glb supported
- Only opaque material. Nothing fancy.
